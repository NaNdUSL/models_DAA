# Data Analysis and Classification Models

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks, each focusing on creating classification models for different tasks.

## Notebooks

1. **Water Potability Classification**:
   - A notebook that analyzes a dataset of water quality features to predict whether water is drinkable.
   - Basic steps include data cleaning, exploration, and building a machine learning model.

2. **Car Incident Risk Classification**:
   - A notebook for predicting car incident risks based on a dataset from a machine learning competition.
   - Focuses on creating a classification model using various algorithms.
